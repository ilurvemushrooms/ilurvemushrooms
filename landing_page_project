          Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published
          by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve
          Ditko, he <b>first appeared</b> in the anthology comic book
          <b>Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962)</b> in the Silver Age of Comic
          Books. He has since been featured in movies, television shows, video
          games, and plays. <br />
          <br />
          Spider-Man is the alias of <b>Peter Parker</b>, an orphan raised by
          his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard
          and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. In his origin story, he gets
          <b>spider-related abilities</b> from a bite from a radioactive spider;
          these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility,
          and detecting danger with his <b>"spider-sense."</b> He also builds
          wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider webs
          of his own design. <br /><br />
          Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful
          superheroes. He has appeared in countless forms of media, including
          several animated and live action television series, syndicated
          newspaper comic strips, and in multiple series of films. The character
          was first portrayed in live action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super
          Stories, a The Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977.

          <br /><br />In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey
          Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom
          Holland. He was voiced by Chris Pine and Jake Johnson in the animated
          film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Reeve Carney starred
          originally as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn
          Off the Dark. Spider-Man has been well received as a superhero and
          comic book character, and he is often ranked as
          <b
            >one of the most popular and iconic comic book characters of all
            time</b
          >
          and one of the most popular characters in all fiction.
